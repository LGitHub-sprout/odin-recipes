This is my <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations">Foundations HTML Course</a> assignment for The Odin Project.

From the initial DOCTYPE to fundemental tags such as headings for proper outline structure (essential for SEO), ordered and unordered lists, and images, I demonstrate my knowledge of the course material to construct a semantic HTML recipe card.

Basic concepts are tag nesting, attributes, and linking embedded content as well as relative link file structure.

The Odin Project is a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online for front-end and full stack web development and programming.
